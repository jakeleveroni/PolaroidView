# Project Name

A Custom UIView that tries to mimic the look and feel of a polaroid picture

## Installation

There is no easy way to install at the moment, im working on turning this 
project into a Cocoapod but for now just clone the repo and add the UIPolaroidView.swift 
and the ExtensionMethods.swift files to your project

## Usage

A custom UIView that looks like a polaroid picture, very easy to integrate.
Just create the polaroid UIView and initialize it using the PolaroidViewBuilder defined in 
PolaroidView.swift
